# Obsidian CMS

Url ðŸ”—: https://exjobb-obsidian-frontend.netlify.app

This is my exam project called Obsidian. I built a headless cms for a fictional Real Estate Agency called "Lillard & Co". The idea behind this cms was to give the owner and employees of Lillard & Co a way to manage their real estate listings, and by using Obsidian they will be able to CRUD their data. This project was later converted into a desktop app using Electron.js.
